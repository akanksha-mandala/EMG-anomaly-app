EMG Signal Analysis System

A full-stack Streamlit application designed to analyze EMG (electromyography) signals, detect anomalies, and provide clinical interpretations to assist doctors and researchers.

Overview

The EMG Signal Analysis System allows doctors to upload patient EMG data in CSV format. The system visualizes the signal, identifies abnormal spikes, and generates a clinical summary and interpretation for further evaluation.

Key Features

Upload EMG data (CSV format)

Interactive EMG signal visualization with anomaly markers

Automatic detection of abnormal muscle activity

Clinical summary including patient ID, muscle type, and detected anomalies

PDF report generation for record-keeping

User-friendly interface for doctors

Tech Stack

Frontend / Interface: Streamlit

Backend & Data Processing: Python, Pandas, NumPy

Visualization: Matplotlib, Plotly

Reporting: FPDF

How It Works

Doctors upload patient EMG CSV data.

The system plots the EMG signal and highlights anomalies.

Anomalies are evaluated against normal muscle activity patterns.

A clinical summary and interpretation are displayed.

Optional: generate a PDF report with all details.

Project Status

This project is currently a fully functional prototype and can be extended with:

Real-time EMG data streaming

Advanced anomaly detection using AI/ML models

Integration with hospital management systems

Deployment on cloud platforms
